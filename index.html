			<p>Alexander Hamilton (<time datetime="1775-01-11">January 11, 1755</time> or <time datetime "1757">1757</time> – <time datetime "1804-07-12">July 12, 1804</time>) was an American 
				statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's 
				financial system, the Federalist Party, 
				the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper. As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies
				of the George Washington administration. He took the lead in the funding of the states' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment
				of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain. His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch,
				a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military. Thomas Jefferson was his leading opponent,
				arguing for agrarianism and smaller government.</p>

			<p>Hamilton was born out of wedlock in Charlestown, Nevis. Orphaned as a child he was taken in by a prosperous merchant. As a precocious young teenager
				he was sent to New York to pursue his education. Hamilton took an early role as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">American Revolutionary 
				War</a> began. In <time datetime="1777">1777</time>, he became a senior aide 
				to General Washington in running the new Continental Army. After the war, Hamilton was elected as a representative to the Congress of the Confederation
				from New York. He resigned to practice law, and founded the Bank of New York.</p>

			<p>Hamilton was a leader in seeking to replace the weak national government, and led the Annapolis Convention in <time datetime="1786">1786</time>, which spurred 
				Congress to call a
				Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. He helped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers">
				Federalist Papers</a>, which to this day remain the single most important reference for Constitutional interpretation.</p>

			<p>Hamilton led the Treasury Department as a trusted member of President Washington's first Cabinet. He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government
				and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt, assume states' debts, and create the
				government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports, and later also by a controversial tax on whiskey.
				To overcome localism, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen, which became the Federalist Party.
				A major issue in the emergence of the American two-party system was the Jay Treaty, largely designed by Hamilton in <time datetime="1794">1794</time>. It established 
				friendly trade relations
				with Britain, to the chagrin of France and supporters of the French Revolution. Hamilton played a central role in the Federalist party, which dominated national and
				state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.</p>

			<p>In <time datetime="1795">1795</time>, he returned to the practice of law in New York. In <time datetime="1789 to 1799">1798–99</time>, under President Adams, Hamilton 
				called for mobilization against France and became Commanding General
				of a newly reconstituted U.S. Army, which he modernized and readied for war. Hamilton's army did not see combat in the Quasi-War, and Hamilton was outraged by Adams'
				diplomatic avoidance of combat with France. His opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause the Federalist party defeat in <time datetime="1800">1800</time>. 
				Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied for the presidency in the electoral college in <time datetime="1801">1801</time>, and Hamilton helped to defeat Burr, whom he found 
				unprincipled, and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences.</p>

			<p>Hamilton continued his legal and business activities in New York City, and was active in ending the legality of the international slave trade. Vice President Burr ran for
				governor of New York State in <time datetime="1804">1804</time>, and Hamilton crusaded against him as unworthy. Taking offense, Burr challenged him to a duel in which 
				Burr mortally wounded Hamilton, who died the next day on <time datetime="1804-07-12">July 12, 1804</time>.</p>
